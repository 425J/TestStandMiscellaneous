# Miscellaneous TestStand Solutions
In this repository, I collect TestStand-based solutions to various problems. The current collection contains:
- **XML to HTML Report Converter** - A sequence to convert TestStand reports in ATML (XML) format to HTML. The solution uses the *msxml6.dll* library preinstalled with Windows. The *msxml* is called as ActiveX Action step.
- **Output to Stream** - A sequence demonstrating the use of streams for create output logs.
