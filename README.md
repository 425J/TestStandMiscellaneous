# Miscellaneous TestStand Solutions
In this repository, I collect TestStand-based solutions to various problems. The current collection contains:
- **XML to HTML Report Converter** - A sequence to convert TestStand reports in ATML (XML) format to HTML. The solution uses the *msxml6.dll* library preinstalled with Windows. The *msxml* is called as ActiveX Action step.
- **Output to Stream** - A sequence demonstrating the use of streams for create output logs. The solution uses *Statements* instead of *Stream* steps.

- **LabVIEW Compiled Object Cache Preparation** - A sequence demonstrating how to programmatically open a LabVIEW project in the IDE and gracefully close it to generate LabVIEW compiled object cache. If in TestStand the LabVIEW adapter is configured to use the LabVIEW Runtime Engine, and the sequence refers to LabVIEW sources (`*.vi` files) that have the *separate compiled code from source file* option selected, then the LabVIEW IDE must first generate a compiled object cache (`[LabVIEW Data]\VIObjCache`) in order not to receive an error.
- **Sequence Progress Station Callback** - A station callback used to display top-level subsequences progress in the output pane.
